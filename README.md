Information to come. For now:  

This is a project where I test a different approach to how to build the code. I am normally quite structured, this is more free flowing in nature and I want to see how that affects quality, effiency but also if it affects how enjoyable it is to code - will it add frustration because of errors and bugs, or is it more relaxing and enjoyable overall?  
  
More info should come here eventually.
